### "Falling leaves tell a story" ---<cite>Elden Ring</cite>
When the ripeness of autumn filled the air in 2022,
I received the Doctor of Philosophy in Statistics and graduated form the [Department of Statistics](http://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) of [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/), 
which brought the promise of new start.

All gratitude is given to Professor [CHAN KinWai](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/kwchan/), who supervised my Phd thesis about Missing Not at Random (MNAR) and parameter estimation.


### "There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves" ---<cite>Tagore</cite>
The Deaparment of Mathematics in [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) nurtured me to be a person with solid foundations of mathematical system including algebra, geometry, partial differential equations, numerical analysis, mathematical statistics and number theory etc..

I really like the lush trees and chirping bird inside the campus. 
My most footloose and fancy-free time is to sit in the SYSU library and feel the wind blowing through.

My work now
======
I am working as a mathematics teacher in [Minxin Hong Kong School (Guangzhou Nansha)](https://www.minxinnansha.org/en/), teaching DSE (Compulsory, M1 and M2) math for secondary school students, and IB in the future.

Attracted by the philosophy: [roots in Hong Kong, a heart for China and a global outlook](https://www.minxinnansha.org/en/archives/729), and curious about the school founded by [Mr LEUNG Chun-ying](http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2023-03/11/c_868231.htm), Vice Chairman, NCCPPCC, I chose Minxin to be the stage of my first job.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://huihuigong.github.io/talkmap.html).
