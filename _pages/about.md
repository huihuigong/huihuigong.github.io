### "Falling leaves tell a story" ---<cite>Elden Ring</cite>
When the ripeness of autumn filled the air in 2022,
I received the Doctor of Philosophy in Statistics and graduated form the [Department of Statistics](http://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) of [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/), 
which brought the promise of new start.

All gratitude is given to Professor [CHAN KinWai](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/kwchan/), who supervised my Phd thesis about Missing Not at Random (MNAR) and parameter estimation.


### "There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves" ---<cite>Tagore</cite>
The Deaparment of Mathematics in [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) nurtured me to be a person with solid foundations of mathematical system including algebra, geometry, partial differential equations, numerical analysis, mathematical statistics and number theory etc..

I really like the lush trees and chirping bird inside the campus. 
My most footloose and fancy-free time is to sit in the SYSU library and feel the wind blowing through.

My work now
======
I am working as a mathematics teacher in [Minxin Hong Kong School (Guangzhou Nansha)](https://www.minxinnansha.org/en/), teaching DSE (Compulsory, M1 and M2) math for secondary school students, and IB in the future.

Attracted by the philosophy: [roots in Hong Kong, a heart for China and a global outlook](https://www.minxinnansha.org/en/archives/729), and curious about the school founded by [Mr LEUNG Chun-ying](http://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2023-03/11/c_868231.htm), Vice Chairman, NCCPPCC, I chose Minxin to be the stage of my first job.
